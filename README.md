# ðŸªŸ Glass Stepping Stones Game (Squid Game Theme)

A command-line Python game inspired by the *Glass Stepping Stones* challenge from Netflix's **Squid Game**.  
Test your luck, memory, and courage as you try to cross a deadly glass bridge â€” step on the wrong tile and you're out!

---

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- The bridge has a sequence of glass steps: left or right.
- One of the two tiles in each row is strong glass, the other is weak and will break.
- Your task is to guess the correct path and reach the end.
- Make a wrong move and it's game over.

## ðŸ§ª Features

- Random bridge generation for each game
- Optional difficulty setting (number of steps)
- Win/loss messages with dramatic Squid Game-style pauses
